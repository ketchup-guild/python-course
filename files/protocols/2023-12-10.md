# Computers & Data

## Agenda

1. What are Computers?
    - Computers vs Calculators
    - Transistors, Binary, Logic
3. What is an Algorithm?
4. Advent of Code 2023, Day 1, Part 1 Pair-programming
    - (Optional) Set up VSCode on Izabela's machine for live-share
    - (Optional) Using Izabela's puzzle input

## Advent of Code

### Day 1, Part 1

```py
# Advent of Code, Day 1

## Algorithm
# 1. What should it do?
#   0. read all the input
#   - figure out first and last number in a line
#      - HOW?
#   - put them together: "1" and "2" turns into "12"
#      - "tre7buchet"[3] == "7"
#      - HOW?
#   - afterwards add them all together
#      - HOW?

        character = text[counter]
        counter = counter + 1

        if character.isdigit(): # if it looks like a number
            firstDigitWeFound = character # it's the first one we found!

    counter = len(text) - 1
    while(counter >= 0 and lastDigitWeFound == "not found"):
        character = text[counter]
        counter = counter - 1
        if character.isdigit():
            lastDigitWeFound = character

    found = f"{firstDigitWeFound}{lastDigitWeFound}"
    foundNum = int(found) # "12" -> 12

    print(f"in {text} we found {found}")
    totalOfNumbers = totalOfNumbers + foundNum
    print(f"our total so far is: {totalOfNumbers}")

print(f"the final total is: {totalOfNumbers}")
